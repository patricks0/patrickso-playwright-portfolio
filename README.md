# patrickso-playwright-portfolio
This repository is my automation testing portfolio, built to showcase hands-on expertise with Playwright.
It demonstrates how to design and execute UI tests, API tests, and CI/CD pipelines using modern best practices.

Key highlights:

- ✅ End-to-end UI test automation with Playwright  
- ✅ API testing using Playwright’s built-in request client  
- ✅ Environment-driven test execution (.env.dev, .env.staging)  
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflows for continuous testing (UI + API)  
- ✅ Use of fixtures, page objects, and network mocking for reliability  

The goal of this repo is to provide a realistic, recruiter-friendly example of automation testing skills — from framework setup to running tests in CI with reporting and artifacts.
